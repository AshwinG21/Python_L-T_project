## ABSTRACT

In today's world telepresence means it is less than a necessity as a person cannot be
everywhere and it can be used for variety of other reasons including saving the lives of
people. Robot can be controlled from a distant location that means it can be controlled from
far location. This paper deals with a very new virtual telepresence robot with added feature
that is head movement control that can be used in defence as well as for educational purposes,
life threatening jobs like mining. Compared to humans. robots can easily survive the
atmosphere which is developed in the field of mining and in defence. In this project, we are
discussing about controlling of robot from distant location. Here the robot is continuously
controlled by head movement which in other terms is known as accelerometer and is captured
by a camera which gives the user real time experience as if he/she present where virtual
telepresence robot is located that is live stream video. The results of the experiments is we can
control the robot via head movement. it is helpful in the field of defense and mining.
By the use of video streaming Telepresence technology enables users to be virtually
present in another location at the same time. it is a kind of user interaction is further enhanced
through mobility by driving remotely to form what is called a Telepresence robot. We can
connect individuals with restricted mobility and increase social interaction, collaboration and
active participation by using innovative machines. However, the individual who is having
little knowledge and map of the remote environment about operating and navigating of these
robot is challenging. Through the narrow camera view and manual remote operation avoiding
obstacles is a cumbersome task. Through the real-time video feed and, thereby, decreasing
their capability to handle different tasks, the users lack the sense of immersion while they are
busy. This project demonstrates a simultaneous mapping and also autonomous driving virtual
reality robot. By using the 2D Lidar sensor, we will generate two dimensional occupancy grid
maps via SLAM and provide assisted navigation to reduce the involving the task of avoiding
obstacles. Through head movement we can control the robot and we will use virtual reality
headset for 3D image. Remote users will be able to gain a visceral understanding of the
environment while operating the robot.
A telepresence robot is nothing but it is a remote-controlled, fixed with wheeled
device with a display which is used to enable the video streaming that enables the participants
to view remote locations, as if they were there in the environment where the robot is placed.
This project consists of a virtual reality headset, with a smartphone in dual screen used to
experience the virtual reality fixed with 4 wheeled robotic vehicle. The movement of the
Robot is controlled using a remote controller. The motion of the camera of the robot is
controlled by the accelerometer and magnetometer data processed by Arduino and Raspberry
Pi.
