# ***ABSTRACT***

In today's world telepresence means it is less than a necessity as a person cannot be
everywhere and it can be used for variety of other reasons including saving the lives of
people. Robot can be controlled from a distant location that means it can be controlled from
far location. This paper deals with a very new virtual telepresence robot with added feature
that is head movement control that can be used in defence as well as for educational purposes,
life threatening jobs like mining. Compared to humans. robots can easily survive the
atmosphere which is developed in the field of mining and in defence. In this project, we are
discussing about controlling of robot from distant location. Here the robot is continuously
controlled by head movement which in other terms is known as accelerometer and is captured
by a camera which gives the user real time experience as if he/she present where virtual
telepresence robot is located that is live stream video. The results of the experiments is we can
control the robot via head movement. it is helpful in the field of defense and mining.
By the use of video streaming Telepresence technology enables users to be virtually
present in another location at the same time. it is a kind of user interaction is further enhanced
through mobility by driving remotely to form what is called a Telepresence robot. We can
connect individuals with restricted mobility and increase social interaction, collaboration and
active participation by using innovative machines. However, the individual who is having
little knowledge and map of the remote environment about operating and navigating of these
robot is challenging. Through the narrow camera view and manual remote operation avoiding
obstacles is a cumbersome task. Through the real-time video feed and, thereby, decreasing
their capability to handle different tasks, the users lack the sense of immersion while they are
busy. This project demonstrates a simultaneous mapping and also autonomous driving virtual
reality robot. By using the 2D Lidar sensor, we will generate two dimensional occupancy grid
maps via SLAM and provide assisted navigation to reduce the involving the task of avoiding
obstacles. Through head movement we can control the robot and we will use virtual reality
headset for 3D image. Remote users will be able to gain a visceral understanding of the
environment while operating the robot.
A telepresence robot is nothing but it is a remote-controlled, fixed with wheeled
device with a display which is used to enable the video streaming that enables the participants
to view remote locations, as if they were there in the environment where the robot is placed.
This project consists of a virtual reality headset, with a smartphone in dual screen used to
experience the virtual reality fixed with 4 wheeled robotic vehicle. The movement of the
Robot is controlled using a remote controller. The motion of the camera of the robot is
controlled by the accelerometer and magnetometer data processed by Arduino and Raspberry
Pi.

# ***INTRODUCTION***

The military is encouraging new advances and improvements in strategy, and is also
often the sponsor of new improvements when it comes to envisioning new innovations
in military settings. Numerous basic military technologies deployed are now advanced
to the piece of industrial robots. In any case, the importance of military autonomy and
modern mechanical autonomy is still quite different. The military has special, robotic
equipment while, in modern terms, the robot is a larger amount of a smart, adaptable,
large-scale manufacturing machine. Later, the use of modern robots for military
applications will always be imaginable. Cost and development of the specialized
capacity of the innovative robot will build the enthusiasm of the military customers. In
this project, we will demonstrate the utilization of robots, inside the military which is
the substitution for people.
From time immemorial, people faced a lot of limitations without technology. But
now as time has passed, people are unable to live without technology. The evolution of
mechanical computers to portable tablets and mobile phone has advanced the human
race to a next higher level. The world we live in now is one that provides the required
entity at just one click. It is also to be noted that the development in science and
technology has introduced the concept of virtual reality and robotics. The term virtual
means near and reality is what we experience as human beings. Hence ‘virtual reality’
means ‘near reality’. Robots have increased widely in today’s world. In almost all the
industries the concept of robotics is used. Robots are also user friendly. Like all real
world applications robot has its own disadvantages. Robot needs a supply of power.
The robot used in this project uses rechargeable battery. Telepresence is the use of
virtual reality technology, especially for remote control of machinery or for apparent
participation in distant events. Virtual telepresence robot allows the user to experience
virtual reality even when the robot is in a remote location.
Telepresence refers to a set of technologies which allow a person to feel as if they
were present, to give the appearance of being present, or to have an effect, via
telerobotics, at a place other than their true location. This kind of user interaction is
further enhanced through mobility by driving remotely to form what is called a
Telepresence robot. These innovative machines connect individuals with restricted
mobility and increase social interaction, collaboration and active participation.
Technical advancements in mobile collaboration have also extended the capabilities of
videoconferencing beyond the boardroom for use with handheld mobile devices,
enabling collaboration independent of location.
A telepresence robot is a remote-controlled, wheeled device with a display to enable
video chat and video conferencing, among other purposes which enable the participants
to see and talk to remote locations, as if they were there. They also enable much more
interactivity than regular video conferencing. In a distance education class, for
example, a telepresence robot can move around the room and interact face-to-face with
individual students, just as an onpremises instructor might. Telepresence robots can
enable remote tour guides, administrative assistants, home visitors, night watchmen and
factory inspectors, among many other possibilities.
